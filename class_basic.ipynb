        "### A. Encapsulation\n",

        "### C. Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same general class through the same interface. Usually, this means different classes can have methods with the same name but different logic.\n",

        "### D. Abstraction\n",
